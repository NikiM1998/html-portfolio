<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 26 years old and have completed my honours degree at the University of Pretoria in Bioengineering. 
  I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Pretoria as well and and I completed my Electronic Engineering degree in 2021.</p>

<p>I am going onto 3 years work experience now and I have worked as a software developer for a tracking company for my first 6 months of work and am currently working as an

  I am looking to take my career to the next level and I am looking for a new challenge. I am looking to work in a company where I can grow and learn new things. I am looking to work in a company
